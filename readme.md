# Introduction

Fissy-UI is a React UI component library, taking inspiration from some of the Starfield UI's.
The main purpose is for me to learn how I can create a light weight NPM package, and have some fun building UI components, what can be useful for others at some point as well.

# Usage

See component library documentation
