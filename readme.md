# Introduction

Fiscy UI is a futuristic React UI component library, taking inspiration from some of the great Starfield UI's. The name comes from playing on scifi, "Fiction Sciency"
The main purpose is to teach myself how I to create an NPM package, experiment with it, and have some fun building UI components.

# Usage
